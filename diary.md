## 2025-09-30: hmmm

**Subject:** The initial spark and a pivot.

Started this project because I was watching a video of Ronnie Coleman screaming in the gym, and at the time I was reading books from Pavel Tsatsoulineâ€”*Power to the People* and *Beyond Bodybuilding*. I saw Codex and Jules were available, so I wanted to test how to work with them (remotely and async) to create a project about weightlifting techniques. And maybe because there are too many weird people in the gym.

> The problem turns out to be very hard. The original idea of a stick figure to represent torque is just a small piece of it. It looks like there isn't much existing code for weightlifting, so the language models can't handle the animation well, and I'm lazy to calculate it myself.

I'm going to scrap the idea of stick figure animation for now. I'll start looking for more mature solutions (like OpenSim, Pyomeca, etc.) and plan to just show charts instead. Whoever cares about techniques should be able to read charts. I believe so.

## 2025-10-01: it is hard

**Subject:** It is getting harder, all of a sudden.

Now I need to read a book to complete this project, a book called Biomechanics of Movement. Because I learnt that the simulation likely is called forward simulation in OpenSim (maybe? and that's the reason I need to read books) , it is compute heavy, but how heavy? And I can't help to think about how to scale my design, it is a burden.
